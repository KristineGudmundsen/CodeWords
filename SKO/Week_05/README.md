## Brief 2: Re-readings

After some minor issues with getting the subtitles to look coherent, we finally managed to finish our recordings. Un Ian volunteered to put it all together and upload it to Youtube. Although we discussed how the tension would build up through the passage, we didn't know if we would be able to visualise this when recording individually. But thanks to teamwork and regular group meetings, I believe we were able to show this in the outcome. 

### Presentation
I was so impressed by how the groups managed to tell the story in different worlds and how diverse everything was. I believe all of the groups managed to convey the creepiness with the story, either in a poetic, melancholic way or with making the worlds and narrative dark and twisted. 


## Brief 3: Major Project

### "Generation Flash" by Lev Manovich, 2005

As I read through the texts, I found ‘Generation Flash’ by Lev Manovich very intriguing. There’s something nostalgic with flash graphics, and the fact that creative coding has in some way, emerged from this is very interesting. 
I had a look at the URL from the text, http://www.whitneybiennial.com, and what I found interesting is that some of these styles are coming back. Also, the use of sound in the browser is something I rarely see nowadays except when it comes to videos. 

Some other nostalgic flash graphics that use sound and have a resemblance to p5 is this old school website:
