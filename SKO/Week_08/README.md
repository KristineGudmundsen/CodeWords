I chose to go with my "Think image. Compare it to sound." idea. My idea was to layer sounds and visuals together in a 3D space. This will demonstrate the sound and visual layering Manovich writes about, as well as creating an interesting reading experience. 

I have always wanted to create more three-dimensional designs as well as getting better at creating multi-sensory experiences, such as using sound. Since I'm not an experienced sound designer, I asked my partner to create sounds in Ableton. It was important to create calm sounds that would be just diverse enough to tell the difference between the layers.

Code Session:
In our live coding session, we learned about preload() and basic sound references. We also looked at how to use the volume() to create designs that would respond to the sound. As I now know how to preload(), play(), loop() and stop() sound, I can start experimenting with sound for my major project.

I also had a look at the p5 libraries to find a suitable library for my 3D code. p5.easycam provides simple 3D camera controls, which looks suitable for my project. I had a look at the OpenProcessing sketches and did the tutorial to get a feel of how it worked.
