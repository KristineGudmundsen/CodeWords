# Week 2

## Modular Typography
I have always been inspired by the architectural look of modular design, and I think that’s why I’m so interested in typography.

After our hunter and gatherer session, I came across this typography workshop Only Studio and DR-Foundry held for Sheffield Hallam University. How they managed to make a whole typeface in just three days is indeed inspiring and motivating and something I would love to do. It's also a good example of modular typography being a playful and friendly way into the type design world.

## Sims
I’m a big fan of Sims and have played it ever since Sims 1 came out. In fact, a lot of my creative imagination started with sims. To use Sims as a tool to tell a horror-story and translate words to image, will be a good exercise to be creative with twisting the friendly-looking graphics. 

The Sims group are Napasorn, Sam, Millicent, Un Ian and me. Since some of us have played Sims before and some not, we created a Teams channel where we posted tutorials, thoughts and discussions.
