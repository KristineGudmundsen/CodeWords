We started the semester with a walk in a virtual rainy Melbourne. It was nice to see some people in the city and to be back at Flinders Station. I enjoyed the creative and playful warm-up to brief 2: re-readings.

Using p5.js for the first time felt overwhelming as I have never coded before, but starting with basic shapes assured me that it's all quite logical and that we're using a program that seems userfriendly with a lot of references and tutorials. 

Seeing how basic shapes, random, and mouseX and Y creates interactive designs that are impossible to do without coding, was very motivating.
