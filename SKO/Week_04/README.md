## Code Session: Spinning type

Learning the basics of typography such as preload() and loadFont(), as well as learning more advanced type related functions, laid a solid foundation for moving into code + words. 

## Sims
As we all had designed our characters + Na designing the house and uploaded them to the sims cloud to be available for the group to download, we all made our individual 'hallways'. As long as the walls were the same, building the 'hallways' individually would create more depth to the story as the 'hallways' are described as endless and shifting.

After recording all the material for my section, I put it all together in Premiere where I also added subtitles. I found monologues, dialogues and descriptions from the passage that seemed fitting. 

## Weekly Inspo

The Berlin-based design and development studio, Martin Wecke, creates beautiful websites where they add interactive details that make the websites a creative playground to explore. I came across the studio a couple of years ago and it is not before now I can look at some of the functions and understand how I can create similar things with p5. 

Such as their menu at the top, or the pmouseX/Y() interaction here:
