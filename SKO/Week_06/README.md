## Tetris

We were introduced to paper prototyping by studying old school online games. By translating the way the game worked to paper prototypes, gave me an understanding of the logic behind the code which led me to pseudocode. 

## PseudoCode

```javascript
Tile starts moving down
IF left arrow is pressed
Move tile to left
IF right arrow is pressed
Move tile to right
WHEN tile is at bottom
New tile start moving down from the top
IF all tiles make up one row
Delete row
ELSE IF
Nothing happens
```

I still need to learn more about how to write efficient pseudocode to be able to write code that will work properly for my major project. I have to look at all the 'what if's' to avoid any unnecessary bugs.


## Weekly Inspo
#### Ruth Wolf-Rehfeldt

As I have been researching typographic art, I came across the German artist, Ruth Wolf-Rehfeldt. 
Moved by the story of the mail art movement and how it was used an antidote to the cultural isolation of the Cold War, I like to think there are some similarities with how we are working on and sharing our code during lockdown. There's also something code like with her designs, and I can see similarities between Wolf-Rehfeldt's designs and generative typography.
