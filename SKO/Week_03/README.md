## Electronic Literature

For me, generative typography is one of the most interesting things with creating coding. I'm sure I'm not the only one finding Win's contribution to the slides intriguing. The Phase typeface explores and displays the creative possibilities with variable typography and creative coding beautifully well.

Exploring electronic literature some more, I came across this electronic literature blog post from 2012, which talks about 'Screen', a project where the reader can interact with the literature. A trippy technological reading installation that would be suitable for a horror story. It's an old link with only images, but you can download the video of the project.

## Sims

Since sims is a life simulation video game that provides realistic film captures, we decided to film our passage in 'documentary style', using movies such as 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Paranormal Activity' as our inspiration. After studying passage 7 of House of Leaves, we divided the passage into five parts that we found interesting to explore, and also deciding who were going to create which character. Sims is not an online game and it was, therefore, important to set some ground rules as we had to film individually.
