# Week 7

## Paper-prototyping

As I read through the whole text, I found the 'remix culture' part interesting, and all of the paragraphs on page 209 - 210 would translate nicely to code. 

### Loop

"Think loop. The basic building block of an electronic sound track, the loop also conquered a surprisingly strong position in contemporary visual culture. Left to their own devices, Flash animations, QuickTime movies, and the characters in computer games loop endlessly—until the human user intervenes by clicking." - Generation Flash by Lev Manovich page 209.

I find how things would loop endlessly until human interaction very interesting, and it would be interesting to explore this through words looping and then shifting direction or animation as the user intervenes by clicking.

### Sampling

"Think sample versus the whole work. If we are indeed living in a remix culture does it still make sense to create whole works—if these works will be taken apart and turned into samples by others anyway?" - Generation Flash by Lev Manovich page 210.

With this, I looked at how I could translate the concept of sampling to typography. By breaking up the type and mixing different parts would talk directly to the text as well as create interesting typographic designs and reading experiences. 

### Layers

"Think image. Compare it to sound. It seems possible to layer many many many sounds and tracks together while maintaining legibility. The results just keep getting more complex, more interesting. Vision seems to work differently." - Generation Flash by Lev Manovich page 210.

I could imagine testing out the theory of the text with layering semi-transparent text on top of each other. 

### Circulation

"Think Internet. What was referred to in post-modern times as quoting, appropriation, and pastiche no longer needs any special name. Now this is simply the basic logic of cultural production: download images, code, shapes, scripts, etc., modify them, and then paste the new works online—send them into circulation." - Generation Flash by Lev Manovich page 210.

With this paragraph, I could visualise a circulation of words where clicking or mouse movements would break up the circulation before sending the words back into circulation again. 

Although it would defiantly be interesting to translate all of the prototypes to code in the future, I will choose one to develop further before next week.
