# Week 10

[Sketch 5](https://kristinegudmundsen.github.io/CodeWords/SKO/Week_10/MajorProjectSketch05/).

I had issues getting the text to be displayed at the planes properly. 
I created an array() with the sentences, and I wanted the texture() to call the sentences from the array on every plane(). 
What happened was that all the sentences showed up on all the planes().  

Sound issue:
Show code to describe.

Even though some of my trials make sense won't work and I feel my attempts is a shot in the dark, I believe the two libraries I use (p5.easycam and p5.sound) are not working well together. Since I am using WEBGL and only 3D objects would work in the code, to play() and loop() sounds in the draw() function creates problems. 

## Google Spreadsheet
After emailing and consultation in class, Karen directed me to the p5.easycam references and the mouse wheel event delta. I still needed to figure out the event and where to put the event.
