# Code + Words

SKO for CodeWords 2020 by Kristine Gudmundsen

I can honestly say that CodeWords has been the most instructive and interesting part of my Communication Design Degree, and it has been a perfect last semester of my bachelor. I am grateful I got the chance to learn how to code before graduating. The studio has not only thought me CamelCase but also opened my eyes for coding and all the interactive possibilities it gives. Itâ€™s through coding I can create those three-dimensional, interactive and multi-sensory experiences I have always wanted to create, but not known how to do. Sharing research on artists such as Stelarc and Sol LeWitt, and typography such as modular typography, generative design and electronic literature (AI dungeon) has given depth to the briefs and given me many inspiring references to take with me to future projects. Thank you for all the code sessions, knowledge sharing, feedback, help, playful lectures and engaging assignments.
